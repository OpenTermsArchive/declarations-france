# Declarations of terms tracked in the *France* collection

The terms in this collection were initially declared by [UFC-Que Choisir](https://www.quechoisir.org) with support from the [Office of the French Ambassador for Digital Affairs](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/politique-etrangere-de-la-france/diplomatie-numerique/), and are now maintained by volunteer contributors. They are tracked using [Open Terms Archive](https://opentermsarchive.org).

You can [explore the tracked versions](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-versions) interactively or [download them as a dataset](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-versions/releases) in the `OpenTermsArchive/france-versions` repository.
