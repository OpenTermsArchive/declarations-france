# Declarations of terms tracked in the *France* collection

The terms in this collection were initially declared by [UFC-Que Choisir](https://www.quechoisir.org) with support from the [Office of the French Ambassador for Digital Affairs](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/politique-etrangere-de-la-france/diplomatie-numerique/), and are now maintained by volunteer contributors. They are tracked using [Open Terms Archive](https://opentermsarchive.org).

You can [explore the tracked versions](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-versions) interactively or [download them as a dataset](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-versions/releases) in the `OpenTermsArchive/france-versions` repository.

## Suggested engine updates

In order to keep the Open Terms Archive engine up-to-date, updates will be automatically suggested by [Dependabot](https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/) in a pull request when a new version is available.

While engine updates follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) standard and automated collection tests should provide a safety net, it is ultimately the responsibility of the maintainers of the collection to check version compatibility and potentially adjust the declarations before applying these updates.
